# Movie Genre

There is a business owner who wants to know which movie genres are available out there, in order to know which categories of movies to have at his online storefront.
In order to do so he needs to know more about movies produced and has a copy of data from the MovieLens project.

I used ArrayLists, HashMaps, FileWriters
