# Top Streaming Artists

A record label executive received text files that contain the top streamed music artists during certain weeks. Each file represents one track by an artist. One track means one song. An artist's name might appear multiple times. The data comes from Spotify Charts

I used ArrayLists, LinkedLists, and FileWriters
