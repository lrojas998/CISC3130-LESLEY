# Music playlist

Your VIP client wants to listen to the music tracks in this week's latest song list to review them and get a sense for what they sound like. This time your client wants you to process all the full weeks of this quarter that have already passed so you're given multiple CSV files of the same format.

I used ArrayLists, LinkedLists, FileWriters, Stacks and Queues
